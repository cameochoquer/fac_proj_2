# Gallery 

The gallery page is the second project in the Founder & Coders application process

## Description
This page is about all the projects that form part of the FAC application. Each project has it's own card that needs to have a description that can be hidden or displayed via user interaction. 

## Planning
1. create html skeleton
2. create css skeleton with flexboxes
3. screenshot images of projects 
4. create function to hide and show text
5. resize and fit for all screens

## How it was built

Building did not follow planning. I started out with a matrix of divs that had diamond shapes. 
I learned how to use flexboxes from the [froggy flexbox game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). 
Resizing the boxes to ensure for smaller screens proved difficult as I used CSS that would move with and change circles to ovals relatively easily. 

Instead of hiding and showing the text I used a function on the image to reveal the text behind. 
It then took a lot of iterating to loop through each project/button to do this on each card. 

## Future Improvements <sub><sub> or what I would've done with more time </sub></sub>
- spacing of project title tag
- centering text in circle
- prettier buttons
